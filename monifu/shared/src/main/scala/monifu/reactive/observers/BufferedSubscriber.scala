/**
 * Interface describing [[monifu.reactive.Observer Observer]] wrappers
 * that are thread-safe (can receive concurrent events) and that
 * return an immediate `Continue` when receiving `onNext`
 * events. Meant to be used by data sources that cannot uphold the
 * no-concurrent events and the back-pressure related requirements
 * (i.e. data-sources that cannot wait on `Future[Continue]` for
 * sending the next event).
 *
 * Implementations of this interface have the following contract:
 *
 *  - `onNext` / `onError` / `onComplete` of this interface MAY be
 *    called concurrently
 *  - `onNext` SHOULD return an immediate `Continue`, as long as the
 *    buffer is not full and the underlying observer hasn't signaled
 *    `Cancel` (N.B. due to the asynchronous nature, `Cancel` signaled
 *    by the underlying observer may be noticed later, so
 *    implementations of this interface make no guarantee about queued
 *    events - which could be generated, queued and dropped on the
 *    floor later)
 *  - `onNext` MUST return an immediate `Cancel` result, after it
 *    notices that the underlying observer signaled `Cancel` (due to
 *    the asynchronous nature of observers, this may happen later and
 *    queued events might get dropped on the floor)
 *  - in general the contract for the underlying Observer is fully
 *    respected (grammar, non-concurrent notifications, etc...)
 *  - when the underlying observer canceled (by returning `Cancel`),
 *    or when a concurrent upstream data source triggered an error,
 *    this SHOULD eventually be noticed and acted upon
 *  - as long as the buffer isn't full and the underlying observer
 *    isn't `Cancel`, then implementations of this interface SHOULD
 *    not lose events in the process
 *  - the buffer MAY BE either unbounded or bounded, in case of
 *    bounded buffers, then an appropriate policy needs to be set for
 *    when the buffer overflows - either an `onError` triggered in the
 *    underlying observer coupled with a `Cancel` signaled to the
 *    upstream data sources, or dropping events from the head or the
 *    tail of the queue, or attempting to apply back-pressure, etc...
 *
 * See [[monifu.reactive.BufferPolicy BufferPolicy]] for the buffer
 * policies available.
