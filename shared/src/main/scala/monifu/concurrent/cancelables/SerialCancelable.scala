/**
 * Represents a [[monifu.concurrent.Cancelable]] whose underlying cancelable
 * can be swapped for another cancelable which causes the previous underlying
 * cancelable to be canceled.
 *
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   val s = SerialCancelable()
 *   s := c1 // sets the underlying cancelable to c1
 *   s := c2 // cancels c1 and swaps the underlying cancelable to c2
 *
 *   s.cancel() // also cancels c2
 *
 *   s() = c3 // also cancels c3, because s is already canceled
 * }}}
 *
 * Also see [[MultiAssignmentCancelable]], which is similar, but doesn't cancel
 * the old cancelable upon assignment.
